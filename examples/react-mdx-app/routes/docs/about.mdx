# About

**Aleph.js** (or **Aleph** or **א** or **阿莱夫**, `ˈɑːlɛf`) is a fullstack framework in [Deno](https://deno.land).

> The name is taken from the book The Aleph by Jorge Luis Borges.

Aleph.js is a module framework that doesn't need webpack or other bundler since it uses the [ES Module] syntax during development. Every module only needs to be compiled once. When a module changes, Aleph.js just needs to re-compile that single module. There is no time wasted re-bundling everytime a change is made. This, along with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and Fast Refresh, leads to instant updates in the browser.

Aleph.js uses modern tools to build your app. It transpiles code using [swc](https://swc.rs) in WASM with high performance, and bundles modules with [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) at build time extremely fast.

Aleph.js works on top of Deno, a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. All dependencies are imported using URLs, and managed by Deno cache system. No `package.json` and `node_modules` directory needed.
